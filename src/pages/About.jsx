            <h3> About me</h3>
            <p> I was ready for a new challenge, so I decided to make a career change and I found out that my old passion for technology was still there. Currently I am part of a feminine Bootcamp at Factoria F5 preparing to be a Full Stack Developer. Being a creative, flexible and problem-solving person helps me adapt easily in constantly changing projects where I work perfectly with my team. In this bootcamp I learnt the Agile methodology which made me work more organized using Kanban or Trello. I am self-motivated person, I learn quickly and I am willing to take training courses if necessary. I have junior level skills in: HTML 5, CSS, Javascript, React (using Node.js to easily build fast and scalable network applications) Java (using frameworks like Spring and tools like PostgreSQL and Gradle) and working with platforms like Docker and Heroku.</p>
